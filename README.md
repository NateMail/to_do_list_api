to-do-list-api by Nathan Mailhiot

USED IN THIS PROJECT: Ruby, Rails

CHALLENGES:
The back end for this project was not to difficult.  I have a user and a resource
that they can crud on.  The biggest challenge for me on the back end was testing
the update. Finding out the correct way to write the curl script was the most
difficult.  After looking for a bit it was a simple fix.
