to-do-list-api by Nathan Mailhiot

TECHOLOGIES USED IN THIS PROJECT: Ruby, Rails, Postgresql

WHAT THIS APPLICATION DOES:
This is the back end for my to-do list application.  It stores, retrieves, and
updates items the user adds to their list.

SITE:https://natemail.github.io/to-do-list-front-end/
This application is a to-do list.  The user is able to create as many to-do
items as they want.  The user can view them.  The user can also update and
delete their to do list items.

MY PLAN:  My plan when staring out with this project was to have the user be able
to CRUD.  I wanted to have one user able to create many resources an manipulate
them as they wish.  I wanted the application to use a Protected Controller.  

CHALLENGES:
The back end for this project was not to difficult.  I have a user and a resource
that they can crud on.  The biggest challenge for me on the back end was testing
the update. Finding out the correct way to write the curl script was the most
difficult.  After looking for a bit it was a simple fix.
